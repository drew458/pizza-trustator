# pizza-tRustator

A simple script that retrieves text from clipboard and translates it in Italian.  
It automatically detects the languange from which you want to translate.

## Usage
It is really time-saving when you assign a keyboard shortcut to it. To do so, create a shortcut of the script, right-click it and give it your preferred keyboard shortcut.  
Note that this may conflict with other keyboard shortcuts in your operating system, so choose it wisely.
